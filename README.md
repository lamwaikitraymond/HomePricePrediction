- Feel free to review my home price prediction assignment, which was assigned by HouseSigma during my interview for the position of Senior MLE.
- This is the task2 of the assessment.
- Although I was rejected by HouseSigma, I still learned something valuable during the follow-up meeting after completing the assignment.
- I am grateful the interviewer said everything in the notebook looks fine!
- Finally, someone appreciates my work!
